# üçΩÔ∏è Philosophers - The Dining Philosophers Problem

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem** in C, solving it using threads and mutexes. It's a fundamental computer science problem that demonstrates concepts of concurrency, synchronization, deadlock prevention, and resource sharing.

### üéØ What is the Dining Philosophers Problem?

Imagine philosophers sitting around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti. Between each pair of philosophers, there's exactly one fork. A philosopher needs **two forks** to eat, but can only pick up the forks immediately to their left and right.

**The Challenge**: How do we ensure that:
- Philosophers don't starve (everyone gets to eat)
- No deadlocks occur (everyone waiting for someone else)
- No race conditions happen (proper synchronization)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux, macOS)
- pthread library support

### Installation & Compilation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Philosopher

# Compile the project
make

# The executable 'philo' will be created
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [optional: number_of_meals]
```

**Parameters (all times in milliseconds):**
- `number_of_philosophers`: Number of philosophers (and forks)
- `time_to_die`: Time before a philosopher dies from hunger
- `time_to_eat`: Time it takes to eat
- `time_to_sleep`: Time spent sleeping
- `number_of_meals`: (Optional) Simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten this many times

### Example Commands

```bash
# Basic simulation - 5 philosophers, should run indefinitely without deaths
./philo 5 800 200 200

# With meal limit - stops when all philosophers eat 7 times
./philo 5 800 200 200 7

# Edge case - single philosopher (will die as they can't get two forks)
./philo 1 800 200 200

# Quick death scenario for testing
./philo 4 310 200 100
```

### Data Structures

#### `t_rules` - Global Simulation Rules
```c
typedef struct s_rules {
    int           n;              // Number of philosophers
    int           t_die;          // Time to die (ms)
    int           t_eat;          // Time to eat (ms)
    int           t_sleep;        // Time to sleep (ms)
    int           eat_goal;       // Optional meal limit (-1 if none)
    long long     start_ms;       // Simulation start timestamp
    int           alive;          // Global alive flag
    int           done_count;     // Count of philosophers who reached meal goal
    t_mtx         print;          // Mutex for synchronized printing
    t_mtx         *forks;         // Array of fork mutexes
    t_mtx         meal_mtx;       // Mutex for meal-related data
    t_mtx         mtx_alive;      // Mutex for alive flag
    t_mtx         mtx_done;       // Mutex for done count
} t_rules;
```

#### `t_philo` - Individual Philosopher
```c
typedef struct s_philo {
    int           id;             // Philosopher ID (1 to n)
    int           left;           // Left fork index
    int           right;          // Right fork index
    long long     last_meal_ms;   // Timestamp of last meal
    int           meals_eaten;    // Number of meals consumed
    t_rules       *rules;         // Pointer to shared rules
    pthread_t     thread_id;      // Thread identifier
} t_philo;
```

### Threading Model

The program creates **n + 1** threads:
- **n philosopher threads**: Each philosopher runs in their own thread
- **1 monitor thread**: Watches for deaths and meal completion

## üîê Synchronization Strategy

### Deadlock Prevention: **Odd/Even Fork Strategy**

To prevent circular waiting (deadlock), philosophers pick up forks in different orders:

```c
if (philosopher_id % 2 == 0) {
    // Even philosophers: right fork first, then left
    lock(right_fork);
    lock(left_fork);
} else {
    // Odd philosophers: left fork first, then right
    lock(left_fork);
    lock(right_fork);
}
```

### Mutex Protection Areas

| Mutex | Protects | Why It's Needed |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `print` | Console output | Prevents message interleaving |
| `forks[i]` | Individual forks | Ensures exclusive fork access |
| `meal_mtx` | Meal timestamps & counts | Prevents race conditions in meal data |
| `mtx_alive` | Global alive flag | Thread-safe simulation termination |
| `mtx_done` | Meal completion counter | Safe tracking of completion |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Algorithms

### Smart Sleep Function
Instead of simple `usleep()`, we use `smart_usleep()` that:
- Checks the alive flag periodically
- Prevents oversleeping when simulation should stop
- Uses small sleep intervals (200Œºs) for responsiveness

```c
void smart_usleep(long long ms, t_rules *r) {
    long long start = now_ms();
    while (check_alive(r)) {
        if (now_ms() - start >= ms) break;
        usleep(200);  // Sleep in small chunks
    }
}
```

### Death Detection
The monitor thread continuously checks if any philosopher has exceeded their time limit:

```c
time_since_last_meal = current_time - philosopher.last_meal_ms;
if (time_since_last_meal > time_to_die) {
    // Philosopher has died!
}
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. **No Death Scenarios** (Should run indefinitely)
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200    # Comfortable timing
./philo 5 600 200 200    # Tighter timing
./philo 4 410 200 200    # Even tighter
```

### 2. **Death Scenarios**
```bash
./philo 1 800 200 200    # Single philosopher (impossible to eat)
./philo 4 310 200 100    # Very tight timing, death likely
```

### 3. **Meal Limit Scenarios**
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200 7  # Stop after everyone eats 7 times
./philo 2 800 200 200 3  # Simple case with 2 philosophers
```

### 4. **Edge Cases**
```bash
./philo 1 400 200 200    # Single philosopher edge case
./philo 2 500 200 200    # Minimum for actual eating
```

## üìä Output Format

Each action is logged with precise timing:

```
<timestamp_ms> <philosopher_id> <action>
```

**Example Output:**
```
0 1 is thinking
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 is eating
200 1 is sleeping
400 1 is thinking
401 2 has taken a fork
401 2 has taken a fork
401 2 is eating
```

**Possible Actions:**
- `has taken a fork`
- `is eating`
- `is sleeping`
- `is thinking`
- `died`

## üõ†Ô∏è Build System

### Makefile Targets

```bash
make          # Build the project
make all      # Same as make
make clean    # Remove object files
make fclean   # Remove object files and executable
make re       # Clean and rebuild
```

### Compilation Flags
- `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`: Strict warning settings
- `-g`: Debug information
- `-lpthread`: Link pthread library

---

## üö® Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Compilation Issues
- **Missing pthread**: Install build essentials on your system
- **Norm errors**: Code follows 42 school norminette standards

### Runtime Issues
- **Immediate death**: Check your timing parameters
- **No output**: Verify parameters are positive integers
- **Segmentation fault**: Usually indicates memory allocation issues

### Understanding the Output
- **Overlapping timestamps**: Normal - multiple philosophers act simultaneously
- **"died" message**: Simulation ends when any philosopher dies
- **No "died" message with meal limit**: Simulation completed successfully

## üéì Learning Concepts

This project teaches essential computer science concepts:

### Threading Concepts
- **Thread creation and management** (`pthread_create`, `pthread_join`)
- **Thread synchronization** with mutexes
- **Race condition prevention**

### Synchronization Primitives
- **Mutex locks** for critical sections
- **Deadlock prevention** strategies
- **Resource allocation** algorithms

### System Programming
- **Time measurement** with `gettimeofday()`
- **Memory management** (allocation and cleanup)
- **Process timing** and scheduling

### Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Producer-consumer** problem variations
- **Resource sharing** among multiple processes
- **Concurrent programming** patterns

---

## üîç Advanced Topics

### Why This Approach?

1. **Odd/Even Strategy**: Breaks the circular wait condition of deadlock
2. **Multiple Mutexes**: Granular locking reduces contention
3. **Monitor Pattern**: Separates concern of death detection from eating logic
4. **Smart Sleep**: Responsive to simulation state changes

### Performance Considerations

- **Mutex Granularity**: Balance between safety and performance
- **Sleep Intervals**: Trade-off between CPU usage and responsiveness
- **Memory Layout**: Structures optimized for cache efficiency

### Alternative Approaches

This implementation could be modified to use:
- **Semaphores** instead of mutexes
- **Process-based** instead of thread-based concurrency
- **Different deadlock prevention** strategies (like resource ordering)
